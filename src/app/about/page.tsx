 Dr. Arif Alvi’s political career commenced with his pro-democracy struggle against the dictatorship of General Ayub Khan. He is a founding member of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) that came into being in 1996. He remained a member of the PTI’s Central Executive Committee since its inception and has held the offices of PTI President of Sindh (1997-2001), Central Vice President (2001-2006) and Secretary General (2006-2013).
